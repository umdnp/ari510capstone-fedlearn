admissiondx

Purpose: The admissiondx table contains the primary diagnosis for admission to the ICU per the APACHE scoring criteria. Entered in the patient note forms. After a fixed period from admission has passed, the table cannot be updated by the caregiver.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

    Patients admission source (medical, surgical) drives the APACHE diagnosis.
    Present for the majority of patients.
    If a patient does not have an admissiondx entry, they should not have an APACHE score.

admitDxText     varchar(255)    NULL    admission diagnosis amplifying value e.g.: 42, 50       S
Detailed description

The admissionDx table includes patient diagnosis date/time, the admit diagnosis path e.g.: admission diagnosis | All Diagnosis| Non-operative | Diagnosis | Cardiovascular | Angina, stable (asymp or stable pattern of symptoms w/meds), the diagnosis' item’s name e.g.: Angina, stable (asymp or stable pattern of symptoms w/meds), and the diagnosis item value.

The APACHE Admission Diagnosis can be entered from within a Care Plan or in Notes (Admission, Readmission, Brief, or Comprehensive Progress Note) for the first 36 hours after ICU admission. The Admission Diagnosis entry is required for APACHE calculations.

The process involves determining whether the admission diagnosis is primarily medical or surgical. Admission from the operating room (OR) causes the systems and diagnoses for surgical diagnoses to be available for selection. Patients not admitted from an OR results in a display of the appropriate medical systems and diagnoses for selection. Surgical diagnosis must be characterized as elective or emergent.

The actual list of diagnoses consists of several hundred items determined by the original creators of the APACHE scoring and prediction tool. The “best” fit for an admission diagnosis based on specific rules is selected by clinicians trained on the APACHE methodology. Patients admitted for trauma should receive a trauma diagnosis. Sepsis diagnoses are part of non-operative cardiovascular diagnoses.

All patients admitted from the Operating room or Recovery room should have a surgical diagnosis, even though some surgical patients have a medical reason for admission to the ICU. When multiple medical problems exist, the acute illness or event that was most immediately life-threatening to the patient or that required the services of the ICU is the one that should be provided.

Detailed description

The allergy table includes patient data entry date/time, note type, specialty type, user type, drug information, etc. Allergy data for the patient can be entered on notes that contain a section for allergies. All allergies (drug and non-drug) can be entered along with necessary pre-admission medications. If a patient reports an allergy to a drug class, a selection from that class (e.g., Penicillin G) may be chosen. The exact nature of the allergy (e.g., allergic to “all penicillins”) may have halso been described with text in the Patient Description field but this field has been excluded to reduce risk of sharing PHI.

Allergy entry is optional. The Daily Progress Note is the most efficient way to enter allergies. Drug allergies entered in other Notes will display here; any allergies listed here will display in subsequent Notes and on a Patient Profile.

apacheApsVar

Purpose: Contains the variables used to calculate the Acute Physiology Score (APS) III for patients. APS-III is an established method of summarizing patient severity of illness on admission to the ICU, and is a part of the Acute Physiology Age Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system of equations for predicting outcomes for ICU patients.

    APACHEPATIENTRESULT
    APACHEPREDVAR

Important considerations

    Acute Physiology Age Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) consists of a groups of equations used for predicting outcomes in critically ill patients.

    APACHE II, III and IV are based on the APS or acute physiology score (which uses 12 physiologic values), age, and chronic health status within one of 56 disease groups. APACHE II is no longer considered valid due to inadequate case mix index adjustments and over estimates mortality because it is based on models from the 1970s-1980s.

    APS points are assigned based upon the “Worst” values (measurement of the degree of physiologic derangement) that a patient exhibits during the APACHE Day. The “Worst” values tend to be those that are furthest away from the APACHE-defined mid-point.

    APACHE III, introduced in 1991, improved the equation by changing the number and weights of the APS and revising the measurement of chronic health status. The APACHE day refers to the time period in which clinical variables can be used in the algorithms.

    APACHE IVa further improved the equations and has been described as having the highest discrimination of any other adult risk adjustment model (SAPS 3, SOFA, MPM III).

    APACHE defines hospital mortality by an admission. discharge, transfer (ADT) hospital disposition as “expired” or “dead”. ICU mortality is defined as a unit dispostion in the ADT system as “expired” or “dead”. Some patients will have more than one ICU admission. For each ICU admission the patient will have a disposition of either dead (expired) or alive.

apachePatientResult

Purpose: Provides predictions made by the APACHE score (versions IV and IVa), including probability of mortality, length of stay, and ventilation days.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

    APACHE defines actual hospital mortality by an admission, discharge, transfer (ADT) hospital disposition as “expired” or “dead”. ICU mortality is defined as a unit dispostion in the ADT system as “expired” or “dead”. Some patients will have more than one ICU admission. For each ICU admission the patient will have a disposition of either dead (expired) or alive.
    Predicted mortality is the percent risk of death for an individual patient. This is displayed as decimal. The sum of every patient’s risk of death within the population of interest equals the number of deaths predicted in that population.
    APACHE ICU length of stay refers to the number of days and partial days that a patient was in an ICU. Hospital LOS represents the total number of days and partial days that a patient was in the hospital during a unique hospitalization.
    Patients with an ICU stay less than 4 hours, most transplant patients, burn patients, and patients less than sixteen years of age will be classified as non-predictive.

Detailed description

Care Plan Provider data includes type (e.g. Admitting, Consultant); specialty (e.g. cardiology), a managing physician indicator, and intervention category which denotes the level of oversight and intervention authorized for eICU clinicians for the patient by a managing physician.

Managing Physician designates the physician who has the overall charge of the patient’s care. In many instances, the managing physician will be the admitting physician. If a consultant, such as an intensivist, is managing care, the consultant should be designated as the managing physician. Only one managing physician at a time may be assigned to the patient. If a managing physician is not selected, the admitting physician will be employed as managing.

Consultants with specialties and intervention categories are provided. Intervention category denotes the level of oversight and intervention authorized for eICU clinicians for a patient by the managing physician.

Important considerations

    The Care Plan in eCareManager is used primarily as an intraprofessional communication tool. Variables related to care provider type and specialty, code status, prognosis, family/healthcare proxy, end-of-life discussions, and various therapies (sedation and analgesia therpaies, airway and ventilation status, and stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis) can be documented on the Care Plan.

    The End-of-Life Discussion section of the Care Plan allows for the care provider who had the discussion, the date/time of the discussion as well as free text comments describing the discussion to be documented.

    The Care Plan in eCareManager is used primarily as an intraprofessional communication tool. Variables related to care provider type and specialty, code status, prognosis, family/healthcare proxy, end-of-life discussions, and various therapies (sedation and analgesia therpaies, airway and ventilation status, and stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis) can be documented on the Care Plan.

    The Care Plan primarily consists of structured picklist items.

    When determining whether a patient recieved a particular therapy other fields within the database are generally used first, and if missing then variables documented on the Care Plan will be used. For example if the fields in the respiratory flowsheet are blank but mechanical ventilation is chosen as an Active Therapy on the Care Plan then the variable of mechanical ventialtion is determined to be true.

Detailed description

The Care Plan provides a unique multi-professional structure that includes features of a daily rounding sheet (daily goals/safety risks) and capabilities to address best practices in a formal, structured manner. Data from the Care Plan help clinicians monitor compliance with established best practices.

The Care Plan is used to enter current treatment information, supportive therapies such as nutritional services, and other clinical and social information including prognosis, code status and family issues. When a patient is transferred, readmitted or changed from stepdown/other, Care Plan data are automatically carried forward from the previous unit stay if within 24 hours.

Patient Information in the care plan includes the following:

    Admit Date
    Acuity: The patient’s acuity status can vary from High (red), Intermediate (yellow), Low (green), or Unknown (gray). After changing the acuity status, click Refresh to synchronize the acuity status throughout the patient chart.
    Admission Diagnosis: Derived from the APACHE Admission Diagnosis (Admission Notes and Care Plan). See APACHEAdmissionDiagnosis for more information.
    Admission Height
    Admission Weight
    Code Status: Includes Full Therapy, Do not Resuscitate, and No Augmentation of Care.
    Care Limitation
    Patient-Family: Includes Baseline Status, Family/Health Care Proxy/Contact Info, End of Life Discussion, Psychosocial Status, and Critical Care Discharge/Transfer Planning and whether the Care Plan Reviewed with Patient/Family

diagnosis

Purpose: Patient diagnosis recorded in the active diagnosis table. Sequence does indicate relative severity. diagnosisPriority is not required.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Brief summary

The diagnosis.md table contains a list of diagnoses that were documented for each patient in the Active Diagnosis/Treatment sections of the eCareManager medical record.The corresponding International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are also available in this table. This can be useful for determining if certain diseases were documented during the ICU stay and at what point in the patient’s ICU stay these diagnoses were documented.
Important considerations

The diagnosis.med table contains diagnoses that were documented in the ICU stay by clinical staff and may or may not be consistent with diagnoses that were coded and used for professional billing or hospital reimbursment purposes. This table does not include diagnoses that may have been documented prior to or after the ICU stay. This table does not indicate which diagnoses were resolved or ruled-out nor does it provide a diagnosis time frame when/if a diagnosis was removed.

infusionDrug

Purpose: Details of drug infusions. Entered from the nursing flowsheet (either manually or interfaced from the hospital electronic health record system).

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

    Infusion drugs entered directly into the source system (eCareManager) by clinicians must include the concentration of the drug being infused. This is done by entering the “drugAmount” and “volumeOfFluid” and this is independent of the amount being infused (drugRate or infusionRate). Interfaced values from source EMRs may not contain the concentration.
    Many EHRs will only interface out the infusion rate so you may only get the mL/hr and it may be difficult to get the actual drug rate unless it’s a standard concentration drug like 10% propofol. The exact drug name and concentration may be present in the medication table to verify concentration.

Let’s take an example row:
infusiondrugid  drugname    drugrate    infusionrate    drugamount  volumeoffluid
2001050     Nitroglycerin (mcg/min)     10  3   50  250

    Concentration will generally be charted in mg and ml. So for this patient with a drugamount = 50 and a volumeoffluid = 250, the administration is from a 50 mg/250 mL bottle of the drug.
    Infusion rate is generally charted as ml/hr. So this patient is receiving 3ml/hr of 50mg/mL of NTG.
    Drug rate units should be specified and should match the calculation obtained from the infusion rate * concentration (which this does once you convert mg to mcg).

intakeOutput

Purpose: Intake and output recorded for patients. Entered from the nursing flowsheet (either manually or interfaced into the hospital system).

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

    Absence of measurement does not indicate absence of intake or output.
    The intakeTotal, outputTotal, diaslysisTotal, and netTotal are cumulative measurements up to the current offset. The value measured for the given row is stored in cellValueNumeric and cellValueText
    When several entries are recorded at the same time for a patient, the values in intaketotal, outputtotal, dialysistotal and nettotal are duplicated!
    outputtotal does not only corrspond to urine output, but also output from drains, blood loss, etc.
    cellvaluenumeric is always POSITIVE, while dialysistotal is NEGATIVE for fluid removal and POSITIVE when fluid is administered to the patient via the dialysis machine.
    With each new entry in intakeoutput, the current daily net total is reported. If several entries happen at the same time, the daily net total will be repeated multiple times. So if you are trying to compute the daily fluid balance, you need to first isolate unique instances of daily net total (select distinct patientunitstayid, intakeoutputoffset, nettotal) and then sum these unique values. Failure to do so will result in a grossly overestimated daily fluid balance.

Important considerations

It is possible some rarely obtained lab measurements are not interfaced into the system and therefore will not be available in the database. Absence of a rare lab measurement, such as serum lidocaine concentrations, would not indicate the lab was not drawn. However, absence of a platelet count would indicate the value was not obtained.

medication

Purpose: The medications table reflects the active medication orders for patients. These are orders but do not necessarily reflect administration to the patient. Titration of continuous infusion medications can be obtained in the infusionDrug table.

Important considerations

    The majority of hospitals have an HL7 medication interface system in place which automatically synchronizes the orders with eCareManager as they are verified by the pharmacist in the source pharmacy system. For hospitals without a medication interface, the eICU staff may enter a selection of medications to facilitate population management and completeness for reporting purposes.

Detailed description

    The following are possible Note types and their intended use. • Admission Note: The Admission Note reflects the patient’s condition upon initial arrival to the unit. It records findings of the patient assessment, conclusions or impressions drawn from the medical history and physical examination, diagnosis or diagnostic impressions, reasons for admission or treatment, goals of the treatment, and treatment plans. Problem groupks are primary, major, or other, while organ systems include neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, etc. • Readmission Note: The Readmission Note reflects the patient’s condition upon subsequent arrivals to the unit (other than the initial arrival) within the same hospitalization. The readmission note is used to record findings of the patient assessment, conclusions or impressions drawn from the medical history and physical examination, diagnosis or diagnostic impressions, reasons for admission or treatment, goals of treatment and treatment plans. • Comprehensive Progress Note: The Comprehensive Progress Note documents the daily course and results of patient care and provides the physician with a comprehensive means of documenting changes in patient status, updates, and interventions. It reflects the patient’s response to treatment, goals of treatment, and treatment plans. This information potentially includes patient description, HPI/Events of Note, preadmission medications, allergies, past history, physical exam, diagnosis/treatment pick list choices, comments for systems or problems, global issues, and plan items. • Daily Progress Note: The Daily Progress Note provides physicians and other clinicians with a user-friendly means of documenting daily patient status. Unlike the Admission, Consultant, and Comprehensive Progress Notes, this Note’s data entry is entirely on one scrollable page. The APACHE Admission Diagnosis, past history, and Active Dx/Rx selections cannot be entered via this note. • Brief Progress Note: The Brief Progress Note documents specific observations, events of note, and clinical management issues of the patient that are needed in addition to a Comprehensive Progress note. It also is intended as the primary note tool for THC use. The brief progress note is generally employed to document THC issues and interventions. Interventions are selected from a structured multi-selection list and are broken down into Major, Intermediate and Minor categories on the basis of clinical acuity. Each category also includes an Other selection. • Initial Consultation/Other Note The Consultation/Other Note accommodates note writing by physicians and clinicians other than the primary or managing physician. Use this note to document specific observations, events, conclusions or impressions drawn from the Physical Examination and diagnosis or diagnostic impressions. You can include allergies/preadmission medications, review of systems, family and social history and other note areas as required to document a complete initial consultation. • Follow-up Consultation/Other Note The Follow-up Consultation Note is used by a consultant physician to document ongoing consultation activity or by any other clinician (including non-physicians) who is not functioning as the primary physician. This note is a parallel note and does not update fields in other areas such as Patient Profile. This note is intended to supplement primary daily care documentation. • Stroke Consultation Note This Note allows stroke consultants to document diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the stroke patient’s medical record. • Procedure Note The Procedure Note allows users to document and track procedures that were performed on a patient. The following Procedure Notes are available: • Catheters: Arterial Catheter Insertion, Central Venous Catheter Insertion, Dialysis Catheter Insertion, Pulmonary Artery Catheter Insertion, Catheter Change Over a Wire, and Catheter Removal • Specialized: Intubation, Extubation, Bronchoscopy, Thoracentesis, Cardioversion, CPR, Lumbar Puncture, and Paracentesis • Generic Procedure notes include the following fields and sections: • User Type field • Date of Service field • Time-Out Process section with a Date of Time-Out Process field, Time-Out Process Check List, and Comments field with optional template(s). • Technical Description • Evaluation • Miscellaneous Information

patient

Purpose: Contains patient demographics and admission and discharge details for hospital and ICU stays.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

All stays are centered on ICU admission. That is, there is no unitAdmitOffset column: it is 0 for all patientUnitStayID. Note that within a hospital admission, distinct unit stays can be linked by patientHealthSystemStayID. Keep in mind that offsets are still based upon patientUnitStayID, for example:
patientUnitStayID   patientHealthSystemStayID   unitDischargeOffset     hospitalAdmitOffset     hospitalDischargeOffset     Comment
2   800     4320    -5040   10960   The second ICU stay.
10  800     2160    -720    15280   The first ICU stay.

The hospital course for this patient was:

    patient admitted to hospital
    first ICU admission (patientUnitStayID = 10) at 720 minutes after hospital admission (hospitalAdmitOffset = -720)
    first ICU discharge (unitDischargeOffset = 2160) at 720+2160 minutes after hospital admission (unitDischargeOffset - hospitalAdmitOffset = 2160 - (-720) = 2880)
    second ICU admission (patientUnitStayID = 2) at 5040 minutes after hospital admission (hospitalAdmitOffset = -5040)
    second ICU discharge (unitDischargeOffset = 4320) at 9360 minutes after hospital admission (unitDischargeOffset - hospitalAdmitOffset = 4320 - (-5040) = 9360)
    hospital discharge, total length of stay = (10960 - (-5040)) = (15280 - (-720)) = 16000

Note that the first ICU stay has a larger hospitalAdmitOffset, because this stay occurred closer to hospital admission (i.e. it was first). Also note that there is no correlation between patientUnitStayID and the order of patient stays.

There is no systematic method for chronologically ordering patientHealthSystemStayID for the same patient within the same year.

treatment

Purpose: The treatment table allows users to document, in a structured format, specific active treatments for the patient.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

The treatment table can only be populated directly into eCareManager as structured text. Absence of a treatment documented in this table should not be used as evidence a specific treatment was not administered. Data includes patient treatment information including date/time, whether the treatment was active upon patient discharge, and the path of the treatment e.g.: neurologic | ICH/ cerebral infarct|thrombolytics | tenecteplase, cardiovascular | arrhythmias | antiarrhythmics | atropine, etc.

vitalAperiodic

Purpose: The vitalAperiodic table provides invasive vital sign data which is interfaced into eCareManager at irregular intervals.

Links to:

    PATIENT on patientUnitStayID

Important considerations

The following vital signs are referred to as aperiodic vital signs, as they are not captured by the system on a regular basis (non-invasive BP can be triggered at an unpredictable variety of time intervals):

    Cardiac output
    Cardiac Index
    Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (“wedge pressure” - PAOP)
    SVR / SVRI
    PVR / PVRI
    Non-invasive blood pressure

Table columns
