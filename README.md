# ARI 510 Capstone Project - Federated Learning

This is a capstone project for the University of Michigan's ARI 510 - Machine Learning course. This project 
focuses on exploring Federated Learning by comparing it with Centralized Learning. Specifically, we evaluate
and contrast various machine learning algorithms in both contexts, concentrating on performance, accuracy,
scalability, and data privacy. By doing so, we aim to identify the strengths and challenges of Federated
Learning, while providing insights into its potential applications and future advancements in the field of
distributed machine learning.

## 🏆 Public Benchmark Competition

**Try the Challenge:** [ICU Prolonged Stay Prediction on Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/12116/)

We've created a public machine learning competition to support reproducible research and community engagement:

- **Task:** Predict prolonged ICU stays (>3 days) using clinical features from the first 24 hours
- **Dataset:** 2,520 ICU patient stays from eICU-CRD-demo (PhysioNet)
  - Training: 1,512 samples with labels
  - Test: 1,008 samples (labels hidden)
- **Metrics:** F1-score (macro), Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression achieving **F1 = 0.7547** on test set
- **Submission Limit:** 5 submissions per day during development phase

**Can you beat our baseline?** Download the starting kit, train your model, and submit predictions to see your ranking on the public leaderboard.

All competition materials are available in [`codabench_bundle/`](codabench_bundle/)
