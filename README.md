# ARI 510 Capstone Project - Federated Learning

This capstone project is part of the University of Michigan's ARI 510 - Machine Learning course. The study
focuses on exploring Federated Learning by comparing it with Centralized Learning. Specifically, the project
will evaluate and contrast various machine learning algorithms in both contexts, concentrating on performance,
accuracy, scalability, and data privacy. By doing so, it aims to identify the strengths and challenges of
Federated Learning, while providing insights into its potential applications and future advancements in the
field of distributed machine learning.
