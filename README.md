# ARI 510 Capstone Project - Federated Learning

This is a capstone project for the University of Michigan's ARI 510 - Machine Learning course. This project 
focuses on exploring Federated Learning by comparing it with Centralized Learning. Specifically, we evaluate
and contrast various machine learning algorithms in both contexts, concentrating on performance, accuracy,
scalability, and data privacy. By doing so, we aim to identify the strengths and challenges of Federated
Learning, while providing insights into its potential applications and future advancements in the field of
distributed machine learning.
