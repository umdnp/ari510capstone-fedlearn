title: "ARI 510 - ICU Prolonged Stay Prediction Challenge"
description: |
  Predict whether ICU patients will have a prolonged stay (>3 days) based on
  admission data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database demo dataset.

  This challenge uses real-world clinical data to build machine learning models
  that can help healthcare providers anticipate resource needs and improve
  patient care planning.

  Competition organized by Jamie O. and Jim P.

  <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>

  <p>
  Predicting ICU length of stay is crucial for resource allocation, care planning,
  and improving patient outcomes. This competition challenges you to build machine
  learning models that predict whether patients will have a prolonged ICU stay
  (>3 days) based on clinical data available at admission.
  </p>

  <h3>Dataset</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> eICU Collaborative Research Database (demo version)</li>
    <li><strong>Training samples:</strong> 1,512 ICU stays with labels</li>
    <li><strong>Test samples:</strong> 1,008 ICU stays (labels hidden)</li>
    <li><strong>Features:</strong> 80+ clinical features</li>
    <li><strong>Class distribution:</strong> 78% not prolonged, 22% prolonged</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Features Include</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> age, gender, ethnicity, admission weight</li>
    <li><strong>Vital signs:</strong> heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation</li>
    <li><strong>Laboratory values:</strong> WBC, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical scores:</strong> APACHE scores, mortality predictions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Evaluation</h3>

  <p>
  Submissions are ranked by <strong>F1 Score (macro-averaged)</strong>, which
  gives equal weight to both classes. This is appropriate for imbalanced medical
  datasets where both sensitivity (catching prolonged stays) and specificity
  (not over-predicting) are important.
  </p>

  <h3>Baseline</h3>

  <p>
  A simple Logistic Regression baseline achieves <strong>F1 = 0.7547</strong> (test set). Can you beat it?
  </p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Download the starting kit (baseline notebook + sample submission)</li>
    <li>Explore the training data and baseline approach</li>
    <li>Build your own model</li>
    <li>Submit predictions on the test set</li>
    <li>See your score on the leaderboard!</li>
  </ol>
